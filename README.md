# Intervals_Calculator

Hello! Thank you for trying out the interval calculator. Here are some of the functions you can do with it:

1) "exit" - exits the program and terminates it
2) "enter (int) (int)" - enters an interval into the current memory
3) "negate" - negates the current interval
4) "invert" - reciprocates the current interval max and min
5) "ms" - saves the current memory into saved memory
6) "mr" - returns saved memory and inputs it into active memory
7) "mc" - clears the saved memory 
8) "m+" - adds the saved and current memory
9) "m-" - subtracts the saved and current memory
10) "scalar_add" - adds the current memory by a scalar value
11) "scalar_subtract" - subtracts the current memory by a scalar value
12) "scalar_multiply" - multiplies the current memory by a scalar value
13) "scalar_divide" - divides the current memory by a scalar value
14) "scalar_divided_by" - divides a scalar value by the max and min values of the interval, and makes it the new max / min of the interval.
15) "interval_add" - adds the current memory by another interval that has to be inputted
16) "interval_subtract" - subtracts the current memory by another interval that has to be inputted
17) "interval_multiply" - multiplies the current memory by another interval that has to be inputted
18) "interval_divide" - divides the current memory by another interval that has to be inputted
19) "intersect" - returns the new interval formed after two intervals are joined 
20) "integers" - returns all of the integers inside an interval
21) "cartesian_integers" - returns the 4 cartesian integers formed by two intervals. more information about cartesian integers can be
